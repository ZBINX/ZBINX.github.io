      <description>Youtube: Golang Tutorial for beginners My coding skills have been RUSTY! I think its time to brush up on my Golang. This time it will be with this free Golang tutorial for beginners offered from the great FreeCodeCamp.org folks. I will be doing this whole course over the next couple weeks and will report back with my findings.
Ultimately I would like to be proficient at a couple languages. I want to create some linux &amp;amp; infosec tools but I would also like to expand my coding skillset to make me a stronger security researcher.</description>

A vulnerability scanner! It uses techniques similar to Nmap to find and report vulnerabilities, which are then, presented in a nice GUI for us to look at. Nessus is different from other scanners as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make assumptions when scanning, like assuming the web application is running on port 80 for instance.</description>

      <description>I kept breaking my site deployment because of an issue with handling the multiple repos and folders from multiple computers. To summarize: When making a hugo deployment site, you should have 2 separate folders. 1 for the source code and the other for public deployment.
 Clone both repos to their own folders locally. git pull inside both so you are up to date with the remote repo. Once changes are made in source code, push the changes.</description>

      <description>How to update git to save your credentials when pulling / pushing? Run the following command:
git config --global credential.helper store Attention: This method saves the credentials in plaintext on your PC&amp;rsquo;s disk. Everyone on your computer can access it, e.g. malicious NPM modules. The credentials are stored in a file on the disk, with the disk permissions of &amp;ldquo;just user readable/writable&amp;rdquo; but still in plaintext.
If the password is changed at some point, your git pull / push will fail and git will then remove the offending user+password from the ~/.</description>
