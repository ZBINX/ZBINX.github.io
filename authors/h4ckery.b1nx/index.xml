      <description>How to fix the unreadable code block that happens in certain themes / configs:  With certain themes you may encounter an issue where you will have unreadable code block highlighting.
 Add the following code at the end of your config.toml  [markup] [markup.highlight] anchorLineNos = false codeFences = true guessSyntax = false hl_Lines = &amp;#39;&amp;#39; lineAnchors = &amp;#39;&amp;#39; lineNoStart = 1 lineNos = false lineNumbersInTable = true noClasses = true style = &amp;#39;vim&amp;#39; tabWidth = 4 pygmentsStyle = &amp;#34;vim&amp;#34;  Edit the following 2 lines:  style = &amp;#39;vim&amp;#39; pygmentsStyle = &amp;#34;vim&amp;#34; You can change these to other chroma styles but the vim one worked best for my current config.</description>
