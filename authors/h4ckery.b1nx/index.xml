      <description>I run a Samba server on my home server to backup files, host pictures, movies, and more. Recently, I discovered a new feature called &amp;ldquo;filebrowser&amp;rdquo; that adds a web interface to access files on my server in a web browser of my choice. With filebrowser, I can simply browse to the URL of the filebrowser address, log in with my username, and then have access to whatever files the admin allows.</description>

      <description>Youtube: Golang Tutorial for beginners My coding skills have been RUSTY! I think its time to brush up on my Golang. This time it will be with this free Golang tutorial for beginners offered from the great FreeCodeCamp.org folks. I will be doing this whole course over the next couple weeks and will report back with my findings.
Ultimately I would like to be proficient at a couple languages. I want to create some linux &amp;amp; infosec tools but I would also like to expand my coding skillset to make me a stronger security researcher.</description>
